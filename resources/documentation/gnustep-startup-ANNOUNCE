The GNUstep Startup Package, version 0.25.0 is now available.

What is the GNUstep Startup Package?
====================================

GNUstep Startup is a compilation of the following core GNUstep packages:
gnustep-make Version 2.4.0
gnustep-base Version 1.21.0
gnustep-gui Version 0.19.0
gnustep-back Version 0.19.0

The main advantage of Startup is that it includes a script to
automatically build and install the core GNUstep system.  

After installing GNUstep Startup, you will have a complete system for
compiling and running GNUstep applications. You will, of course, need
to compile and install applications (such as GWorkspace) to actually
use GNUstep in a runtime system. For a complete developement system,
you would also need to install the Gorm and ProjectCenter
applications.

The installation scripts have been tested on:

Darwin/PPC 8.x
Darwin/PPC 7.x
Solaris/SPARC 2.7
NetBSD/ix86
NetBSD/sparc64
Debian Unstable/ix86
Gentoo/ix86
MingW/ix86

NOTES: Some systems (Debian, FreeBSD, Gentoo,
etc) have precompiled binaries of GNUstep available through their
normal distribution system. It may be preferable to get GNUstep this
way.

Note for developers and testers: You can use these scripts to build
the libraries from SVN. Just make sure the 'core' directory is at the
same level as the 'startup' directory, and run the InstallGNUstep script
from startup.
