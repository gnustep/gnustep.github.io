    <p>

        The release notes include descriptions of API changes, behaviour
	changes and other information that might help developers and users
	migrate to using a newer version of the library.
          </p>

	    <h2><a name="001001000000">Version 1.29.0</a></h2>
    <p>

          Bugfix release to increment library version number to reflect ABI
          changes which should have been noticed before 1.28.1 release.
            </p>

	    <h2><a name="001002000000">Version 1.28.1</a></h2>
    <p>

          Aside from an assortment of bugfixes, this release includes a lot of
          improvements for Windows support as well as security features.
            </p>
    <p>

          Not every bugfix, improvement or a new feature will be listed here.
            </p>
<br />

        GSTLS: Use strict rfc4514 for distinguished names of issuer and
        owner of certificates.  Add GSTLSIssuers and GSTLSOwners properties
        to reject remote certificates which do not match distinguishd names
        accepted.  This allows encrypted DO to be configured to automatically
        reject connection attempts which do not have trusted certificates.
        Add -pending method allowing NSFileHandle and NSStream to detect when
        there is buffered data in the TLS layer that they could read.
        Honor the SSL_CERT_FILE environment variable for OpenSSL compatibility.

        GSXML.m: Remove usage of deprecated function when a newer version of
        libxml is used.<br />

        NSCalendar: New methods with testcases and documentation.<br />

        NSConnection: Add debug output reporting the details of any exception
        returned over a DO connection from the remote process or thread.<br />

        NSFileHandle: On ms-windows support overlapped I/O on standard
        streams.<br />

        NSFileManager: Fix bug creating NSDirectoryEnumerator instances, and
        ensure we eeally skip hidden files in enumerations if requested by
        the options.<br />

        NSIndexPath: New methods to support collection and table view.<br />

        NSLock: Use native APIs on ms-windows.

        NSOperation: Fix various bugs in operation finishing, completion block,
        and removal of dependency observers.
        Remove the maximum number of threads restriction and use
        the setting from -setMaxConcurrentOperationCount: instead.<br />

        NSPredicate: fix error parsing an array whose entry is an NSExpression
        object.<br />

        NSRegularExpression: Fix possible corruption when using ICU strings
        longer than 16 characters.

        NSSocketPort: APIs to permit Distributed Objects connections to be TLS
        encrypted for secure inter-process communications.

        NSString: Use ICU on ms-windows.  Fix various obscure bugs.

        NSTask: Use .exe extension implicitly if needed on ms-windows.
 
        NSThread: Use native APIs on ms-windows.

        NSTimeZone: Rewrite to support the latest (v2+) timezone file format
        and transition data held as 64bit values rather than the 32bit values
        needed so far.
        ms-windows compatibility fixes.

        NSURL: Improve handling of clients (including making client lookup
        thread-safe).
        When making a request to retrieve an http/https URL, improve
        debug output, mask sensitive authentication header detials, and provide
        delegate metods/api to permite callers to filter the debug log to remove
        any other sensitive information.<br />

        NSURLHandle: Use the https_proxy and http_proxy
        environment variables if no proxying is specified. Also support
        those keys as properties in the request (overriding the environment
        variables) and support the URL protection space if set.
        Improve handling of the remote end dropping the connection (reconnect
        if the request has not been sent).<br />

        NSXMLParser: do not process end tag if parsing was aborted
        while processing start tag.<br />

        Testcases: Changes to work with a C99 compiler.
        Fixes for NSTask tests to work on ms-windows. 
        Exclude NSBundle framework tests on ms-windows.
        Skip tilde abbreviation tests on ms-windows.
        Skip GSInetServerStream based testcases on win32<br />

        Context.getFilesDir() as the basis for storing data (e.g. NSUserDefaults) and
        when querying for directory paths (NSLibraryDirectory,
        NSApplicationSupportDirectory, etc.).<br />
        Placeholder NSScript* classes. Added NSUserActivity, NSObjectScripting,
        NSHFSFileTypes, NSAppleEventManager and NSAppleEventDescriptor.<br />

        Travis build improvements to use new runloop integration and gnustep-2.0
        runtime.<br />
        In NSKeyValueObserving, implement two missing methods for NSArray:
        -addObserver:options:context: and
        -removeObserver:fromObjectsAtIndexes:forKeyPath:.<br />

        to use the ARC-compatible ENTER_POOL and LEAVE_POOL macros.<br />
        When building the list of hosts to be probed to see if they have gdomap
        servers, fix code to include those explicitly defined in the config file.
        Add -S option to list the addresses of the known gdomap servers.<br />
        Backward compatibility fix for ICU 65.<br />
        Update GSPrivateSymbolPath() so that, on the path where LINKER_GETSYMBOL
        is not available, we attempt to lookup classes using the prefix ._OBJC_CLASS_
        for the 2.0 ABI (earlier ABIs use a prefix of __objc_class_name_ for the class
        definition.<br />
        Fix parsing of NSURLResponse content type header.<br />
        Fix for class lookup when using the 2.0 ABI.<br />
        Fixed NSURLComponents setURL: throwing exceptions when URL didn&apos;t have
        all expected parts caused by rangeOfString: throwing for nil values.<br />
        Added NSURLQueryItem implementation.
            </p>

    <p>
A new stable release.<br />
        Removes garbage collection support (though for now the

            </p>

	    <h2><a name="001008000000">Version 1.24.8</a></h2>
    <p>
A new stable (bugfix) release.<br />
        The release contains a variety of bugfixes as well as some
        performance optimisations (particularly in the use of tiny string
        objects by the new objc runtime on 64bit systems).<br />
        Thread naming and logging of threads by NSLog() has been made
        consistent with the latest OSX releases, making debugging of
        multithreaded code a little easier.<br />
        Sergei Golovin has added NSURLConnection regression tests (while

	    <h2><a name="001009000000">Version 1.24.7</a></h2>
    <p>
A new stable (bugfix) release.<br />
        The release has various platform/portability tweaks, as
        well as a variety of bugfixes.<br />
        The default HTTPS connection configuration is modified to disable

        This release also contains an update to include the most recent
        international timezone data.
            </p>

	    <h2><a name="001010000000">Version 1.24.6</a></h2>
    <p>
A new stable (bugfix) release.<br />
        This release contains a new class (NSUUID) and several
        new methods.<br />
        The OSX version compatibility macros have been updated
        to add the latest version of OSX.<br />
        The release has various platform/portability tweaks, as
        well as a variety of bugfixes.
            </p>

	    <h2><a name="001011000000">Version 1.24.5</a></h2>
    <p>
A new stable (bugfix) release.<br />
        The main reason for this version is to release a collection of minor
        bugfixes before making more extensive changes which will break ABI
        compatibility and appear in a 1.25 branch.<br />
        This release contains a new class (NSInvocationOperation) and a few
        new methods.<br />
        The OSX version compatibility macros have been updated to permit use
        of the same numeric values as on OSX.<br />
        The release has been through the clang static analyzer (with minor
        issues resolved) and has had clang&apos;s printf format checking used
        to correct issues (mostly with NSInteger/NSUInteger on 64bit systems)
        with printf formats in various debug/logging messages.<br />
        Timezone data was updated for this release.
            </p>

	    <h2><a name="001012000000">Version 1.24.4</a></h2>
    <p>
A new stable (bugfix) release.<br />
        The main reason for this version is the inclusion of the latest
        available time zone data (something accidentally omitted from the
        previous release).<br />
        Most of the other changes in this version are fairly minor portability
        and bugfixes (and the addition of a number of new testcases).<br />
        API changes are limited to the addition of a few OSX-10.7 methods
        for NSCalendar and a few new NSFileManager methods for working
        with URLs.<br />
        Finally, there is experimental code to change the hashing algorithm
        used in the library ... enabling it will cause slower hash generation
        but a better distribution of hash values ... which might improve the
        performance of large collections.
            </p>

	    <h2><a name="001013000000">Version 1.24.3</a></h2>
    <p>
A new stable release.<br />
	Many changes in this version are behavior updates/improvements
	but there are also new APIs, none of which should effect binary
	compatibility with earlier 1.24.x releases.<br />
	An important change at the configure stage is that configure policy
        now requires you to explicitly disable features in order to build if
        external packages that those features depend on are missing.  This
        should ensure that builds of base contain consistent feature sets
        unless you really want to change that.
	    </p>
    <p>
The main changes are:<br />
	Implementation of the NSXML DOM classes (previously stubs).  This is
        by far the biggest chunk of new code in this release.
        The DOM support has a dependency on the libxml2 library.<br />
	Implementation of cookies in the NSURLConnection related classes.<br />
	Implementation of common HTTPS support in the NSURLConnection
        related classes and the older NSURLHandle.  The HTTPS support has
        a dependency on the gnutls library.<br />
        Implementation of new sorting code for faster sorting and to allow
        sorting algorithms to be changed.<br />
	Many changes to add support for ObjectiveC-2.0 additions.<br />
	Implementation of Encoding/Decoding of NSAffineTransform.<br />
	Many, many minor bugfixes and tweaks.
	    </p>

	    <h2><a name="001014000000">Version 1.24.0</a></h2>
    <p>
A new stable release.<br />
	Most changes in this version are behavior updates/improvements
	rather than new API, but you should be aware that there is a
	binary incompatibility on 64bit systems in that the value of
	the NSNotFound constant there is now 64bits rather than 32bits.
	    </p>
    <p>
With this release the official supported compiler for GNUstep
	is gcc-4.0 and later, and the base library has been tested using
	recent gcc development snapshots.
	    </p>
    <p>
The main changes are:<br />
	Support for the GNU LANGUAGES environment variable and other locale
	improvements.<br />
	Caching of file and directory path information within bundles.<br />
	IPV6 support for NSHost and networking operations.<br />
	Support for UTF-8 string literals in source (compiler permitting).<br />
	Improved support for building standalone application bundles.<br />
	And of course, lots of bugfixes and OSX compatibility tweaks.
	    </p>
    <p>
One this that didn&apos;t make it into this release was functioning
	NSXML DOM classes.  For DOM style work you still need to use the

	    <h2><a name="001015000000">Version 1.23.0</a></h2>
    <p>
A new stable release with many minor bugfixes and tweaks.<br />
	The main changes however are David Chisnall&apos;s work adding support
	of the clang compiler and Objective-C 2.0 language/runtime (the
	compiler/runtime combination now provides full support for the
	Objective-C 2.0 language).<br />
	Garbage collection using clang and libobjc2 is now available in
	addition to the existing gcc runtime garbage collection support.<br />
	Going beyond that, for people who don&apos;t like garbage collection,
	there is now support for automated reference counting, where the
	clang compiler adds reference count calls to manage object lifetimes,
	relieving the application developer from the need to manage reference
	counts.
	    </p>
    <p>
An important point to note is that this is the last release to
	support the gcc-2.9.5 compiler.  In future, while releases may work
	with older systems, the formal requirement will be a gcc-4.x series
	compiler or later and base may also depend on support for the C99
	standard being available.<br />
	This change is being made in order avoid developers needing to spend
	a great deal of time keeping code working for obsolete systems which
	are no longer used in practice.
	    </p>

	    <h2><a name="001016000000">Version 1.22.0</a></h2>
    <p>
A new stable release with many updates and changes. In addition
	to many new classes and methods, there is now a regression test
	framework included in the base release.  
	    </p>
    <p>
In addition, base now
	supports and uses the Objective-C 2.0 runtime API from Apple and
	we encourage anyone programming with GNUstep to move to using this
	new runtime and the new functionality it supports. Note however, 
	there is currently no compiler/runtime combination that completely
	supports the Objective-C 2.0 specification, but we would
	recommend the following:
	    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        gcc (pre 4.6) and GNUstep libobjc is the preferred
	compiler/runtime for stability (best tested)
      </li>
      <li>
        gcc 4.6 and GNU libobjc for experimental ObjC2 with
	garbage collection but without blocks
      </li>
      <li>
        clang and GNUstep libobjc2 for experimental ObjC2 without
	garbage collection but with blocks.

	  a distribution packaging system refuses to allow unresolved link
	  symbols in a library.  The code was reworked to use a weak reference
	  to a local function, avoiding this problem.

This is a new unstable snapshot release of the base library
	almost identical to 1.19.2 but containing a bugfix for the
	introduction of a change in the behavior of NSURL&apos;s -path
	method to match OSX.  We add a new -fullPath method which
	returns the actual path of the URL the way the old -path
	implementation did.  This is necessary because the OSX behavior
	is to strip any trailing &apos;/&apos; from a path so that it&apos;s no longer
	possible to reliably build a URL string from its component parts.

The current emphasis of the base library is MacOS-X compatibility,
        and the headers in this release mark many non-MacOS-X methods as being
        scheduled for removal by the next unstable release (from 1.17.0).<br />
        These methods will mostly be moved to the &apos;additions&apos; library,
        (which can be built stand-alone in conjunction with the Cocoa Foundation
        framework as libgnustep-baseadd on OSX) and their declarations will
        be in the headers of that library (&lt;GNUstepBase/...&gt;) rather
        than in the <em>Foundation</em> directory.<br />
        NB. The markup in the headers and documentation should not be
        assumed to be exhaustive ...  it is planned that the next stable
        release of the base library will enforce MacOS-X compatibility
        by default, and you will have to explicitly include headers from
        &lt;GNUstepBase/...&gt; in order to use GNUstep specific
        additions.<br />
        You should track the unstable branch of the base library (subversion
        trunk) to find out what changes your software actually needs to make.
            </p>
    <p>
The TODO list for MacOS-X 10.5 compatibility follows,
        this is all stuff which would ideally be done by the next
        stable release of this library.

      <dt>NSContainsRect behavior change</dt>
      <dd>
        
	      The definition of NSContainsRect has changed to

      <dt>Unichar file paths</dt>
      <dd>
        
	      Windows supports unichar file paths, but there isn&apos;t
	      really an API for handling this. GNUstep-specific
	      methods for dealing with this have been
	      added, <code>NSFileManager&apos;s
	      -localFromOpenStepPath</code> and
	      <code>openStepPathFromLocal</code> and equivalent methods for
	      <code>NSString</code>. In most cases the Base library should
	      handle this problem internally, but it&apos;s possible that there
	      are cases where the developer wants to handle the file name
	      explicitly with system-specific functions.

	      The designated initializer for  NSArray, NSDictionary,

	      the class from a subclass, although it is prefered that you use
	      the <em>designated initializer</em>, with it&apos;s richer
	      set of initializers.

      <dt>Interface version change</dt>
      <dd>
        
	    The interface version of the base library has changed in
	    this release, as it will in all future releases with a
	    new minor number (that&apos;s the second number in the
	    release number). Applications, libraries and tools that
	    wish to use this new version must be recompiled
	    (otherwise, they&apos;ll use the older version of the library).
	    There is no single reason for this change. Arguably, it
	    should have been done long ago.

	    When extraneous data is encountered in the input, it is ignored

	    raise an exception or extend the api to return the extra
