<span id="Distributed-Objects-1"></span><h2 class="chapter">7 Distributed Objects</h2>
<span id="index-distributed-objects"></span>

<p>Until now we have been concentrating on using the Objective-C language
to create programs that execute in a single process. But what if you
want your program to interact with objects in other processes, perhaps
running on different machines?
</p>
<p>As a simple example, we may have a client process that needs to access a
telephone directory stored on a remote server. The client process could
send a message to the server that contained a person&rsquo;s name, and the
server could respond by returning that person&rsquo;s number.
</p>
<p>The GNUstep base library provides a powerful set of classes that make
this type of remote messaging not only possible, but easy to program. So
what do these classes do and how can we use them? To answer that we must
first look at the way code interacts with objects in a single process,
and then look at how we can achieve the same interaction with objects
that exist in different processes.
</p>
<span id="Object-Interaction"></span><h3 class="section">7.1 Object Interaction</h3>
<span id="index-object-interaction_002c-remote-objects"></span>

<p>To continue with the example above, if the telephone directory existed
in the same process as the code that was accessing it, then a simple
message would return the wanted telephone number.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">  NSString *wantedNumber = [telephoneDirectory teleNumber: personName];
</pre></div>

<p>Now object and method names just hold pointers to memory addresses. The
code executed at run time in response to the <code>teleNumber</code> message
is located at an address held by the name of the responding method (a
variable), while data in the telephone directory is located at an
address held by the <code>telephoneDirectory</code> variable.
</p>
<p>In a single process these addresses can be accessed by the client code
at run time, but if the telephone directory is located on a remote
server, then the address of the remote object is not known in the client
process (the <code>telephoneDirectory</code> object and its responding method
are said to exist in a separate &rsquo;address space&rsquo;).
</p>
<p>The Objective-C run-time library was not designed for this inter-process
communication or &rsquo;remote messaging&rsquo;.
</p>
<span id="The-GNUstep-Solution"></span><h3 class="section">7.2 The GNUstep Solution</h3>
<span id="index-distributed-objects-1"></span>
<span id="index-remote-objects"></span>
<span id="index-client_002fserver-processes"></span>
<span id="index-NSConnection-class"></span>
<span id="index-NSProxy-class"></span>
<span id="index-NSRunLoop-class"></span>

<p>GNUstep overcomes these limitations by providing you with classes that
form what is known as a &rsquo;distributed objects&rsquo; architecture that
extends the capabilities of the run-time system.
</p>
<p>With the addition of a few lines of code in the client and server
programs, these extensions allow you to send a message to a remote
process by constructing a simple Objective-C statement. In the telephone
directory example, the statement to retrieve the telephone number would
now look something like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">  NSString *wantedNumber = [proxyForDirectory teleNumber: personName];
</pre></div>

<p>Compare this to the original statement:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">  NSString *wantedNumber = [telephoneDirectory teleNumber: personName];
</pre></div>

<p>Notice that the only difference between the two statements is the name
of the object receiving the message, i.e. <code>proxyForDirectory</code>
rather than <code>telephoneDirectory</code>. GNUstep makes it as simple as
this to communicate with an object in another process.
</p>
<p>The variable <code>proxyForDirectory</code> is known as a &rsquo;proxy&rsquo; for the
remote <code>telephoneDirectory</code> object. A proxy is simply a substitute
for the remote object, with an address in the &rsquo;address space&rsquo; of the
local client process, that receives messages and forwards them on to the
remote server process in a suitably coded form.
</p>
<p>Let us now take a look at the additional lines of code required to make
this &rsquo;remote messaging&rsquo; possible.
</p>
<span id="Code-at-the-Server"></span><h4 class="subsection">7.2.1 Code at the Server</h4>
<span id="index-distributed-objects_002c-client-code"></span>

<p>In order to respond to client messages, the responding server object must be
set as the &rsquo;root object&rsquo; of an instance of the <code>NSConnection</code> class, and
this <code>NSConnection</code> must be registered with the network by name. Making
an object available to client processes in this way is known as &rsquo;vending&rsquo; the
object. The registered name for the <code>NSConnection</code> is used by the client
when obtaining a proxy for the responding server object over the network.
</p>
<p>The only other code you need to consider is the code that listens for incoming
messages. This &rsquo;runloop&rsquo;, as it is known, is started by sending a <code>run</code>
message to an instance of the <code>NSRunLoop</code> class.  Since an
<code>NSRunLoop</code> object is created automatically for each process, there is no
need to create one yourself. Simply get the default runloop, which is returned
by the <code>+currentRunLoop</code> class method.
</p>
<p>When the runloop detects an incoming message, the message is passed to the
root object of the <code>NSConnection</code>, which performs a method in response to
the message and returns a variable of the appropriate type. The
<code>NSConnection</code> manages all inter-process communication, decoding incoming
messages and encoding any returned values.
</p>
<p>The code to vend the <code>telephoneDirectory</code> object and start the
runloop would look something like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">/*
 * The main() function: Set up the program
 * as a 'Distributed Objects Server'.
 */
int main(void)
{
  /*
   * Remember, create an instance of the
   * NSAutoreleasePool class.
   */
  CREATE_AUTORELEASE_POOL(pool);

  /*
   * Get the default NSConnection object
   * (a new one is automatically created if none exists).
   */
  NSConnection *connXion = [NSConnection defaultConnection];

  /*
   * Set the responding server object as
   * the root object for this connection.
   */
  [connXion setRootObject: telephoneDirectory];

  /*
   * Try to register a name for the NSConnection,
   * and report an error if this is not possible.
   */
  if ([connXion registerName: @&quot;DirectoryServer&quot;] == NO)
  {
    NSLog(@&quot;Unable to register as 'DirectoryServer'&quot;);
    NSLog(@&quot;Perhaps another copy of this program is running?&quot;);
    exit(1);
  }

  /* Start the current runloop. */
  [[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] run];

  /* Release the pool */
  RELEASE(pool);
  return 0;
}
</pre></div>

<p>These additional lines of code turn a program into a distributed objects
server, ready to respond to incoming client messages.
</p>
<span id="Code-at-the-Client"></span><h4 class="subsection">7.2.2 Code at the Client</h4>
<span id="index-distributed-objects_002c-client-code-1"></span>

<p>At the client, all you need do is obtain a proxy for the responding
server object, using the name that was registered for the <code>NSConnection</code>
at the server.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">  /* Create an instance of the NSAutoreleasePool class */
  CREATE_AUTORELEASE_POOL(pool);

  /* Get the proxy */
  id proxy = [NSConnection
    rootProxyForConnectionWithRegisteredName: <i>registeredServerName</i>];
	
  /* The rest of your program code goes here */

  /* Release the pool */
  RELEASE(pool);
</pre></div>

<p>The code that obtains the proxy automatically creates an NSConnection
object for managing the inter-process communication, so there is no need
to create one yourself.
</p>
<p>The above example serves to establish a secure connection between processes
which are run by the same person and are both on the same host.
</p>
<p>If you want your connections to work between different host or between
programs being run by different people, you do this slightly differently,
telling the system that you want to use &rsquo;socket&rsquo; ports, which make TCP/IP
connections over the network.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">int main(void)
{
  CREATE_AUTORELEASE_POOL(pool);

  /*
   * Create a new socket port for your connection.
   */
  NSSocketPort *port = [NSSocketPort port];

  /*
   * Create a connection using the socket port.
   */
  NSConnection *connXion = [NSConnection connectionWithReceivePort: port
							  sendPort: port];

  /*
   * Set the responding server object as
   * the root object for this connection.
   */
  [connXion setRootObject: telephoneDirectory];

  /*
   * Try to register a name for the NSConnection,
   * and report an error if this is not possible.
   */
  if ([connXion registerName: @&quot;DirectoryServer&quot;
    withNameServer: [NSSocketPortNameServer sharedInstance]] == NO)
  {
    NSLog(@&quot;Unable to register as 'DirectoryServer'&quot;);
    NSLog(@&quot;Perhaps another copy of this program is running?&quot;);
    exit(1);
  }

  [[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] run];

  RELEASE(pool);
  return 0;
}
</pre></div>

<p>In the above example, we specify that the socket port name server is used
to register the name for the connection ... this makes the connection name
visible to processes running on other machines.
</p>
<p>The client side code is as follows
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">  /* Create an instance of the NSAutoreleasePool class */
  CREATE_AUTORELEASE_POOL(pool);

  /* Get the proxy */
  id proxy = [NSConnection
    rootProxyForConnectionWithRegisteredName: <i>registeredServerName</i>
    host: <i>hostName</i>
    usingNameServer: [NSSocketPortNameServer sharedInstance]];
	
  /* The rest of your program code goes here */

  /* Release the pool */
  RELEASE(pool);
</pre></div>

<p>If the <i>hostName</i> in this statement is &rsquo;nil&rsquo;
or an empty string, then only the local host will be searched to find the
<i>registeredServerName</i>. If <i>hostName</i> is &quot;*&quot;, then all hosts on the
local network will be searched.
</p>
<p>In the telephone directory example, the code to obtain the proxy from
any host on the network would be:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">  id proxyForDirectory = [NSConnection
    rootProxyForConnectionWithRegisteredName: @&quot;DirectoryServer&quot;
    host: @&quot;*&quot;
    usingNameServer: [NSSocketPortNameServer sharedInstance]];
</pre></div>

<p>With this additional line of code in the client program, you can now
construct a simple Objective-C statement to communicate with the remote
object.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">  NSString *wantedNumber = [proxyForDirectory teleNumber: personName];
</pre></div>


<span id="Using-a-Protocol"></span><h4 class="subsection">7.2.3 Using a Protocol</h4>
<span id="index-protocol-for-distributed-objects"></span>
<span id="index-distributed-objects_002c-using-a-protocol"></span>

<p>A client process does not need to know the class of a remote server
object to avoid run-time errors, it only needs to know the messages to
which the remote object responds. This can be determined by the client
at run-time, by asking the server if it responds to a particular message
before the message is sent.
</p>
<p>If the methods implemented at the server are stated in a formal
protocol, then the client can ask the server if it conforms to the
protocol, reducing the network traffic required for the individual
message/response requests.
</p>
<p>A further advantage is gained at compile time, when the compiler will
issue a warning if the server fails to implement any method declared in
the protocol, or if the client contains any message to which the server
cannot respond.
</p>
<p>The protocol is saved to a header file and then included in both client
and server programs with the usual compiler <code>#include</code>
directive. Only the server program needs to implement the methods
declared in the protocol. To enable compiler checking in the client
program, extend the type declaration for the proxy to this protocol, and
cast the returned proxy object to the same extended type.
</p>
<p>In the telephone directory example, if the declared protocol was
<code>TelephoneDirectory</code>, declared in header file
<code>protocolHeader.h</code>, then the client code would now look like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">  #include &quot;protocolHeader.h&quot;;

  /* Extend the type declaration */
  id&lt;TelephoneDirectory&gt; proxyForDirectory;

  /* Cast the returned proxy object to the extended type */
  proxyForDirectory = (id&lt;TelephoneDirectory&gt;) [NSConnection
    rootProxyForConnectionWithRegisteredName: @&quot;DirectoryServer&quot;
    usingNameServer: [NSSocketPortNameServer sharedInstance]];
</pre></div>
<p>Since class names and protocol names do not share the same &rsquo;address
space&rsquo; in a process, the declared protocol and the class of the
responding server object can share the same name, making code easier to
understand.
</p>
<p>For example, <code>proxyForDirectory</code> at the client could be a proxy for
an instance of the <code>TelephoneDirectory</code> class at the server, and
this class could implement the <code>TelephoneDirectory</code> protocol.
</p>

<span id="Complete-Code-for-Telephone-Directory-Application"></span><h4 class="subsection">7.2.4 Complete Code for Telephone Directory Application</h4>

<p>Here we provide the rest of the code needed for client and server to actually
run the above example.
</p>
<p><b>Code At Server</b>
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">#include &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;

/* Include the TelephoneDirectory protocol header file */
#include &quot;TelephoneDirectory.h&quot;

/*
 * Declare the TelephoneDirectory class that
 * implements the 'teleNumber' instance method.
 */
@interface TelephoneDirectory : NSObject &lt;TelephoneDirectory&gt;
@end

/*
 * Define the TelephoneDirectory class
 * and the instance method (teleNumber).
 */
@implementation TelephoneDirectory : NSObject
- (char *) teleNumber: (char *) personName
{
  if (strcmp(personName, &quot;Jack&quot;) == 0) return &quot; 0123 456&quot;;
  else if (strcmp(personName, &quot;Jill&quot;) == 0) return &quot; 0456 789&quot;;
  else return &quot; Number not found&quot;;
}
@end

 /* main() function: Set up the program  as a 'Distibuted Objects Server'. */
 /*   [use code from server example above ...] */
</pre></div>

<p><b>Code at Client</b>
</p>

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">#include &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;

/* Include the TelephoneDirectory protocol header file */
#include &quot;TelephoneDirectory.h&quot;

/*
 * The main() function: Get the telephone number for
 * 'personName' from the server registered as 'DirectoryServer'.
 */
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  char *personName = argv[1];
  char *returnedNumber;
  id&lt;TelephoneDirectory&gt; proxyForDirectory;
  CREATE_AUTORELEASE_POOL(pool);

  /* Acquire the remote reference. */
  proxyForDirectory = (id&lt;TelephoneDirectory&gt;) [NSConnection
    rootProxyForConnectionWithRegisteredName: @&quot;DirectoryServer&quot;
    host: @&quot;*&quot;
    usingNameServer: [NSSocketPortNameServer sharedInstance]];

  if (proxyForDirectory == nil)
    printf(&quot;\n** WARNING: NO CONNECTION TO SERVER **\n&quot;);
  else printf(&quot;\n** Connected to server **\n&quot;);

  if (argc == 2) // Command line name entered
  {
    returnedNumber = (char *)[proxyForDirectory teleNumber: personName];
    printf(&quot;\n%s%s%s%s%s\n&quot;, &quot;** (In client) The telephone number for &quot;,
           personName, &quot; is:&quot;,
           returnedNumber, &quot;  **&quot;);
  }
  else printf(&quot;\n** No name entered **\n&quot;);
  printf(&quot;\n%s\n\n&quot;, &quot;** End of client program **&quot;);
  RELEASE(pool);
  return 0;
}
</pre></div>

<p>To get this running, all you need do is create two directories, one for the
client and one for the server. Each directory will hold a makefile, the client
or server source code, and a copy of the protocol header file. When the files
compile, first run the server and then the client.  You can try this on the
same machine, or on two different machines (with GNUstep installed) on the
same LAN. What happens when you run the client without the server? How would
you display a &quot;No Server Connection&quot; warning at the client?
</p>

<span id="GNUstep-Distributed-Objects-Name-Server"></span><h4 class="subsection">7.2.5 GNUstep Distributed Objects Name Server</h4>
<span id="index-gdomap"></span>
<span id="index-Distributed-Objects-Name-Server_002c-GNUstep"></span>

<p>You might wonder how the client finds the server, or, rather, how it finds the
directory the server lists itself in.
</p>
<p>For the default connection type (a connection only usable on the local host
between processes run by the same person), a private file (or the registry
on ms-windows) is used to hold the name registration information.
</p>
<p>For connections using socket ports to communicate between hosts,
an auxiliary process will
automatically be started on each machine, if it isn&rsquo;t running already, that
handles this, allowing the server to register and the client to send a query
behind the scenes.  This <i>GNUstep Distributed Objects Name Server</i> runs as
&rsquo;<code>gdomap</code>&rsquo; and binds to port 538.  See the manual page or the HTML
&ldquo;GNUstep Base Tools&rdquo; <a href="../../Tools/Reference/index.html">documentation</a> for further information.
</p>

<span id="Look-Ma_002c-No-Stubs_0021"></span><h4 class="subsection">7.2.6 Look Ma, No Stubs!</h4>

<p>One difference you may have noticed in the example we just looked at from
other remote method invocation interfaces such as CORBA and Java RMI was that
there are <i>no stub classes</i>.  The source of this great boon is described at
the end of this chapter: <a href="#Distributed-Objects">Language Support for
Distributed Objects</a>.
</p>

<span id="A-More-Involved-Example"></span><h3 class="section">7.3 A More Involved Example</h3>
<span id="index-distributed-objects_002c-example-_0028no-error-checking_0029"></span>
<span id="index-game-server-example"></span>

<p>Now we will look at an example called GameServer that uses distributed objects
in a client/server game.
</p>
<p>Actually the game itself is not implemented, just its distributed support
structure, and while the code to vend an object and connect to a remote
process is similar to that already shown, the code does show a number of
additional techniques that can be used in other client/server programs.  Here
are the requirements we will implement:
</p>
<ul>
<li> When the client attempts to join the game, the server checks that the client
is entitled to join, based on the last time the client played.  The rule is:
if the client lost the last game, then they cannot re-play for the next 2
hours; but if the client won the last game, then they can re-play the game at
any time (a reward for winning).<br>

</li><li> The server also makes sure the client is not already connected and playing the
game (i.e. they cannot play two games at the same time - that would be
cheating).<br>

</li><li> In addition to a proxy for the server being obtained at the client, a proxy
for the client is received at the server. This allows two-way messaging, where
the client can send messages to the server and the server can send messages to
the client (e.g. the state of play may be affected by the actions of other
players, or by other events at the server).<br>

<p>Two protocols will therefore be required, one for the methods
implemented at the server and one for those implemented at the client.
</p></li></ul>

<p>Have a look at the program code in the following sections and added
comments. Can you work out what is happening at the server and client? If you
have any difficulties then refer to the relevant sections in this manual, or
to class documentation <a href="../Reference/index.html">here</a> or at the Apple
web site.
</p>

<span id="Protocol-Adopted-at-Client"></span><h4 class="subsection">7.3.1 Protocol Adopted at Client</h4>

<p>We have chosen <code>GameClient</code> as the name of both the protocol
adopted at the client and the class of the responding client object. The
header file declaring this protocol will simply declare the methods that
the class must implement.
</p>

- (void) clientMessage: (bycopy NSString *)theMessage;

<p>To summarise the code at the client:

can now communicate with the client using the methods declared in the

<span id="Code-at-the-Server-1"></span><h4 class="subsection">7.3.4 Code at the Server</h4>

<p>The server code contains the <code>main</code> function and the
<code>GameServer</code> class declaration and implementation.
</p>
<p>The <code>main()</code> function vends the server&rsquo;s root object and starts the
runloop, while the <code>GameServer</code> class adopts the <code>GameServer</code>
protocol. The class also implements methods that initialise and
deallocate the root object&rsquo;s instance variables (dictionaries that hold
player information).

<p>To summarise the code at the server:
</p>
<ul>
<li> We vend the server&rsquo;s root object and start a runloop, allowing clients to
connect with the server.<br>

</li><li> When we receive a proxy for a client object, we communicate with that client
using methods declared in the <code>ClientServer</code> protocol.<br>

</li><li> We create three dictionary objects, each referenced by player
name. <code>currentUsers</code> holds proxies for each of the current players;
<code>delayUntil</code> holds times when each player can re-join the game; and
<code>hasWon</code> holds a string for each player, which is set to &quot;YES&quot; if the
player wins.<br>

</li><li> When the game is in progress, the server can alter the state of each client
object to reflect the success of each player.
</li></ul>

<p>I hope you managed to understand most of the code in this example. If
you are reading the on-screen version, then you can copy and paste the
code to suitably named files, create makefiles, and then make and run
each program. What message is displayed if you immediately try to
re-join a game after losing? And after winning?
</p>
<p><i>Exercise: Modify the server code so that the server records the
number of wins for each player, and displays this information at both
the start and end of each game.</i>

<span id="Language-Support-for-Distributed-Objects"></span><h3 class="section">7.4 Language Support for Distributed Objects</h3>

<p>Objective-C provides special &rsquo;type&rsquo; qualifiers that can be used in a
protocol to control the way that message arguments are passed between
remote processes, while at run time, the run-time system transparently
uses what is known as &rsquo;forward invocation&rsquo; to forward messages to a
remote process.  (See <a href="Advanced-Messaging.html">Forwarding</a>.)
</p>

<span id="Protocol-Type-Qualifiers"></span><h4 class="subsection">7.4.1 Protocol Type Qualifiers</h4>
<span id="index-protocol-type-qualifiers"></span>
<span id="index-in_002c-out_002c-and-inout-type-qualifiers"></span>
<span id="index-out_002c-type-qualifier"></span>
<span id="index-oneway_002c-type-qualifier"></span>
<span id="index-bycopy-and-byref-type-qualifiers"></span>

<p>When message arguments are passed by value then the receiving method can
only alter the copy it receives, and not the value of the original
variable. When an argument is passed by reference (as a pointer), the
receiving method has access to the original variable and can alter that
variable&rsquo;s data. In this case the argument is effectively passed &rsquo;in&rsquo; to
the method, and then passed &rsquo;out&rsquo; of the method (on method return).
</p>
<p>When an argument is passed by reference to a remote object, the network
must handle this two-way traffic, whether or not the remote object
modifies the received argument.
</p>
<p>Type qualifiers can be used in a protocol to control the way these
messages are handled, and to indicate whether or not the sending process
will wait for the remote process to return.
</p>
<ul>
<li> The <b>oneway</b> qualifier is used in conjunction with a
<code>void</code> return type to inform the run-time system that the sending
process does not need to wait for the receiving method to return (known
as &rsquo;asynchronous&rsquo; messaging). The protocol declaration for the receiving
method would look something like this:<br><br>

<p><code>- (<b>oneway</b> void)noWaitForReply;</code><br><br>
</p>
</li><li> The <b>in, out </b> and <b>inout</b> qualifiers can be used with pointer
arguments to control the direction in which an argument is passed. The
protocol declaration for the receiving methods would look something like
this:<br>

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">/*
 * The value that 'number' points to will be passed <b>in</b> to the remote process.
 * (No need to return the argument's value from the remote process.)
 */
<code>- setValue: (<b>in</b> int *)number;</code>

/*
 * The value that 'number' points to will be passed <b>out</b> of the remote process.
 * (No need to send the argument's value to the remote process.)
 */
<code>- getValue: (<b>out</b> int *)number;</code>

/*
 * The value that 'number' points to is first passed <b>in</b> to the remote
 * process, but will eventually be the value that is passed <b>out</b> of the
 * remote process. (Send and return the argument's value.)
 */
<code>- changeValue: (<b>inout</b> int *)number;</code>
</pre></div>

<p>Passing of arguments by reference is very restricted in Objective-C.
it applies only to pointers to C data types, not to objects, and except
for the special case of a pointer to a nul terminated C string (<b>char*</b>)
the pointer is assumed to refer to a single data item of the specified
type.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">/*
 * A method passing an unsigned short integer by reference.
 */
<code>- updateCounter: (<b>inout</b> unsigned shortn *)value;</code>

/*
 * A method passing a structure by reference.
 */
<code>- updateState: (<b>inout</b> struct stateInfo *)value;</code>

/*
 * As a special case, a char (or equivalent typedef) passed by reference
 * is assumed to be a nul terminated string ... there is no way to pass
 * a single character by reference:
 */
<code>- updateBuffer: (<b>inout</b> char *)str;</code>

</pre></div>

</li><li> The <b>bycopy</b> and <b>byref</b> qualifiers can be used in a protocol
when the argument or return type is an object.<br><br>

<p>An object is normally passed by reference and received in the remote
process as a proxy. When an object is passed by copy, then a copy of
the object will be received in the remote process, allowing the remote
process to directly interact with the copy. Protocol declarations would
look something like this:<br>
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">/*
 * Copy of object will be received in the remote process.
 */
- sortNames: (<b>bycopy</b> id)listOfNames;

/*
 * Copy of object will be returned by the remote process.
 */
- (<b>bycopy</b> id)returnNames;
</pre></div>

<p>By default, large objects are normally sent <b>byref</b>, while small
objects like <code>NSStrings</code> are normally sent <b>bycopy</b>, but you
cannot rely on these defaults being adopted and should explicitly state
the qualifier in the protocol.<br><br>
</p>

<p>The <b>bycopy</b> qualifier can also be used in conjunction with the
<b>out</b> qualifier, to indicate that an object will be passed <b>out</b> of
the remote process by copy rather than by proxy (no need to send the
object).<br>
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">/*
 * The object will not be received in the remote process, but the object
 * will be returned <b>bycopy</b>.
 */
- sortAndReturn: (<b>bycopy out</b> id *)listOfNames;
</pre></div>

<p>You should be aware that some classes ignore the <b>bycopy</b> qualifier
and the object will be sent by reference. The <b>bycopy</b> qualifier will
also be ignored if the remote process does not have the class of the
object in its address space, since an object&rsquo;s instance variables are
accessed through the object&rsquo;s methods.<br><br>
</p>
<p>When a copy of an object is sent to a remote process, only the object&rsquo;s
instance variables are sent and received (an object&rsquo;s methods exist in
the address space of the object&rsquo;s class, not in the address space of the
individual object).
</p>
</li></ul>

<span id="Message-Forwarding"></span><h4 class="subsection">7.4.2 Message Forwarding</h4>
<span id="index-message-forwarding_002c-distributed-objects"></span>
<span id="index-forward-invocation_002c-distributed-objects"></span>

<p>If you have used other remote invocation mechanisms such as CORBA or Java
RMI, you may have noticed a big difference from these in the GNUstep
Distributed Object paradigm &ndash; there are no &ldquo;stub&rdquo; classes, either on the
client or the server.  This tremendously simplifies the use of remote
invocation and is possible due to the Objective-C message-forwarding facility
(<a href="Advanced-Messaging.html">Forwarding</a>).
</p>
<p>In GNUstep, there are proxies on the client and server side that handle
network communications and serialization/deserialization of arguments and
return values just as in CORBA and RMI, but when it comes to responding to the
client and server protocol method calls themselves, they are intercepted
through the use of the <code>forwardInvocation:</code> method, where they can be
passed on to the registered client and server objects through the ordinary
Objective-C message sending mechanism.
</p>

<span id="Error-Checking"></span><h3 class="section">7.5 Error Checking</h3>
<span id="index-error-checking_002c-distributed-objects"></span>
<span id="index-distributed-objects_002c-error-checking"></span>

<p>When dealing with distributed objects your code must be able to handle
the following situations: failure to vend the server object, exceptions
raised at run-time, and failure of the network connection.
</p>
<span id="Vending-the-Server-Object"></span><h4 class="subsection">7.5.1 Vending the Server Object</h4>
<p>When vending the server object, your code must be able to handle the
situation in which the network does not accept the proposed registered
name for the server.
</p>
<span id="Catching-Exceptions"></span><h4 class="subsection">7.5.2 Catching Exceptions</h4>
<p>There are two situations to consider.
</p><ul>
<li> An <code>NSPortTimeoutException</code> is raised.<br><br>
This exception is raised if a message takes too long to arrive at the
remote process, or if a reply takes too long to return. This will happen
if the remote process is busy, has hung, or if there is a problem with
the network. The best way to handle the exception is to close the
connection to the remote process.<br><br>

</li><li> An exception is raised in the remote process while the remote
process is executing a method.<br><br>
In most cases you can deal directly with these exceptions in the process
in which they were raised; i.e. without having to consider the network
connection itself.
</li></ul>

<span id="The-Connection-Fails"></span><h4 class="subsection">7.5.3 The Connection Fails</h4>
<p>You can register an observer object to receive a notification, in the
form of a <code>connectionDidDie:</code> message, when a registered connection
fails. The argument to this message will be an <code>NSNotification</code>
object that returns the failed connection when it receives an
<code>object</code> message.  See <a href="Base-Library.html">Event-Based Communications</a>
for more information on notifications.
</p>
<p>To receive this &rsquo;notification&rsquo; the observer must implement the
<code>connectionDidDie:</code> method, but can be an instance of any class. The
observer can then handle the failure gracefully, by releasing any
references to the failed connection and releasing proxies that used the
connection. Registering an object to receive this notification is
described in more detail in the <code>NSConnection</code> class documentation.
