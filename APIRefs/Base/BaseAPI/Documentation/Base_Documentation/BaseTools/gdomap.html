    <p>

	The gdomap daemon is used by GNUstep programs to look up distributed
	objects of processes running across the network (and between different
	user accounts on a single machine).  The deamon is <em>NOT</em> used
	for lookup where two processes belonging to the same user are using a
	host-local connection.
          </p>
    <p>

	  If you are packaging GNUstep for inclusion in a software distribution
	  you may want to skip to the final section of this document.
          </p>
    <p>

          Usually the gdomap daemon is started at system boot time and binds
          itself to port 538.  (See the GNUstep Build Guide for a sample
          startup script.)  It expects to receive fixed-size request packets
          for registering, deregistering, and looking up distributed objects
          servers.  The response packets vary in length depending on the type
          and content of the information requested.  In addition, limited
          support for federation is provided by a rudimentary gdomap-gdomap
          communications protocol.
          </p>
    <p>

          What follows is a description of gdomap from a developer
          perspective.  For information pertinent for users, such as how to
          configure and start up gdomap, please see the man page for more
          information (&quot;man 8 gdomap&quot;).
          </p>
    <p>

  	  The name server is intended to work with both the UDP and the TCP
          protocols.  It is intended that the TCP interface be used by
          GNUstep programs, while the UDP interface is intended primarily
          for communication between name servers on different machines.
          </p>

              <h2><a name="001001000000">Usage Scenario</a></h2>
    <p>

              A complete distributed-objects &quot;conversation&quot; between a client
              and a server looks like the outline below.  The gdomap daemon
              only plays a role in the &quot;pre-&quot; and &quot;post-&quot; phases.  Everything
              else is conducted &quot;peer-to-peer&quot; between the two GNUstep
              processes.

          <li>
            
                          Server registers an object as being available as the
                          &apos;root object&apos; on a particular port with a specific
                          name.

                          Client connects to the port and asks for the root
                          object.

          <li>
            
                          Client then proceeds to send messages to the object.

          <li>
            
                          Server sends message responses except where methods
                          are declared &apos;oneway&apos;.

          <li>
            
                          The server may also send messages to the client and

                          Eventually, the client or the server disconnects by
                          invalidating port or connection or just exiting.

              <h2><a name="001002000000">How it Works and Why</a></h2>
    <p>

              The fixed size of a request packet was chosen for maximum
              ease and speed of implementation of a non-blocking name server.
              The server knows how much it needs to read and can therefore
              usually do a read as a single operation since it doesn&apos;t have
              to read a little, figure out request length, allocate a buffer,
              and read the rest.
              </p>
    <p>

              The server name length (bytes) is specified - no assumptions
              should be made about whether the name contains nul characters
              or indeed about the name at all.  This is future-proofing.
              </p>
    <p>

              Why UDP as well as TCP?
              The OpenStep specification says that a connection may be
              established to any host on the local network which supplys a
              named service if the host name is specified as &apos;*&apos;.
              </p>
    <p>

              This means that the application must poll to see if it can
              find a server with the name it wants.  The polling could take
              a huge amount of time!
              </p>
    <p>

              To make this all easier - the server is capable of supplying
              a list of those hosts on the local network which it knows to
              have (or have had) a name server running on them.
              </p>
    <p>

              The application then need only poll those name servers to find
              the service it wants.
              </p>
    <p>

              However - to give the application a list of hosts, the name
              server must have got the information from somewhere.
              To gather the information the server has to poll the machines
              on the net which would take ages using TCP since attempts to
              talk to machines which are down or do not exist will take a
              while to time out.
              </p>
    <p>

              To make things speedy, the server sends out GDO_PROBE requests
              on UDP to all the machines on the net when it starts up.
              Each machine which has a name server notes that the new name
              server has started up and sends back a GDOPREPLY packet so
              that the new name server will know about it.
              </p>
    <p>

              Things are never perfect though - if a name server dies, the
              other name servers won&apos;t know, and will continue to tell
              applications that it is there.
              </p>
    <p>

              Port type codes - these are used to say what the port is for so
              that clients can look up only the names that are relevant to them.
              This is to permit the name server to be used for multiple
              communications protocols (at the moment, tcp or udp) and for
              different systems (distributed objects or others).
              This guarantees that if one app is using DO over UDP, its services
              will not be found by an app which is using DO over TCP.
              </p>

              <h2><a name="001003000000">Communications Protocol</a></h2>
    <p>

              The communications protocol is identical for both TCP and UDP
              and consists of a simple request-response sequence.
              </p>
    <p>

              Each request is a single message consisting of -
              </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        
                  a single byte request type
              
      </li>
      <li>
        
                  a single byte giving name length,
              
      </li>
      <li>
        
                  a single byte specifying the type of port being registered
                  or looked up, or a nul byte for probe operations.
              
      </li>
      <li>
        
                  a single nul byte.
              
      </li>
      <li>
        
                  a four byte port number in network byte order must be
                  present for register operations, otherwise this is zero.
              
      </li>
      <li>
        
                  a service name of 0 to GDO_NAME_MAX_LEN bytes (or two IP
                  addresses in network byte order and an optional list of
                  additional addresses for probe operations)
              
      </li>
      <li>
        
                  0 to GDO_NAME_MAX_LEN nul bytes padding the service name to
                  its full size.
              
      </li>
      <li>
        
                  a terminating nul byte.
              
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>

              The total is always sent in a packet with everything after the
              service name (except the final byte) cleared to nul bytes.
              </p>
    <p>

              Each response consists of at least 4 bytes and depends on the
              corresponding Request Type and where it came from as follows -
              </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>GDO_LOOKUP</dt>
      <dd>
        
                  Looks up the server name and returns its port number.
                  Response is the port number in network byte order, or zero
                  if the named server was not registered.
              
      </dd>
      <dt>GDO_REGISTER</dt>
      <dd>
        
                  Registers the given server name with a port number.  This
                  service is only available to processes on the same host as
                  the name server.  Response is the port number in network
                  byte order, or zero if the named server was already
                  registered.
              
      </dd>
      <dt>GDO_UNREG</dt>
      <dd>
        
                  Un-register the server name and return old port number.  If
                  the server name is of length zero, and the port is non-zero
                  then all names for the port are unregistered.  This service
                  is only available to a process on the same host as this name
                  server.  Response is the old port number in network byte
                  order, or zero if the name could not be un-registered.  If
                  multiple names were unregistered the response is the port
                  for those names.
              
      </dd>
      <dt>GDO_SERVERS</dt>
      <dd>
        
                  Return a list of the known servers on the local net.
                  Response is an unsigned long (in network byte order) saying
                  how many servers the name server knows about, followed by a
                  list of their IP addresses in network byte order.  NB. This
                  response may not be possible over UDP as the response length
                  may exceed the maximum UDP packet size.
              
      </dd>
      <dt>GDO_NAMES</dt>
      <dd>
        
                  Return a list of registered names known to the server.
                  Response is an unsigned long (in network byte order) saying
                  how many bytes of data are to follow, followed by a list of
                  the names each preceeded by the name length (a single byte)
                  and port type (a byte).  NB. This response may not be
                  possible over UDP as the response length may exceed the
                  maximum UDP packet size.
              
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>

              The following are used for communications between name servers -
              </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>GDO_PROBE</dt>
      <dd>
        
                  Requests a response Passes two IP addresses in the name
                  field - first the address of the sender, next that of the
                  recipient.  The packet may (optionally) include a variable
                  number of addresses (as specified by the name length minus
                  the size of the two addresses), each of which is an internet
                  address on which the sender is also listening.  For a
                  request from a name server via UDP there is no response, but
                  a GDO_REPLY request is sent.  For a request from a
                  non-name-server, or a TCP connect, the response is the port
                  number of this server in network byte order.
              
      </dd>
      <dt>GDO_PREPLY</dt>
      <dd>
        
                  Replies to a GDO_PROBE via UDP from a name server.  The
                  format of the message is as for GDO_PROBE.  No response is
                  sent.
              
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>

	    The gdomap process is a system daemon used to coordinate
	    services between different machines.  As such it should be
	    started (as root) at system boot time (if inter-host messaging
	    is desired), and you need to write the appropriate startup
	    scripts for your system and put them in place when the
	    package is installed.<br/>
	    Alternatively you may install gdomap setuid to run as root,
	    and GNUstep programs will launch it on demand ... but this
	    is not recommended as it provides lass control than when
	    you write a proper startup script.
	      </p>
    <p>

	    The default operation of gdomap is to probe the hosts on the
	    local network to find other machines with copies of gdomap
	    running, so that all the machines on the network can be kept
	    informed of the seervices provided by GNUstep servers.<br/>
	    This probing may be considered unfriendly by other users of
	    the LAN, so it is usually better to provide a configuration
	    file specifying the IP addresses of machines to be probed,
	    and start up gdomap at boot time with the command line option
	    to tell it to read the file.
