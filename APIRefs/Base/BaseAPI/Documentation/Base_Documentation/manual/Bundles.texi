GNUstep does not have frameworks as such but it still has bundles and the
means of loading them.  IMHO frameworks ought to be reconsidered since they
are a very useful construct.  Java uses them to great benefit now (resources
go into jars, which are like frameworks, and there are .war and .ear archive
types with more specialized roles).  It is true that dylib loading is a
system-dependent process, however this could be solved by the use of symbolic
links on unix systems, and post-install copying on Windows systems.
