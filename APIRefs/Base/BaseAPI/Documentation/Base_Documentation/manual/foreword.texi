@c @unnumbered Foreword

The aim of this document is to provide a GNUstep/Objective-C programming
manual (primarily tutorial in style) for the language, the GNUstep Base
library, and the GNUstep Make package.  While to focus is on Objective-C, the
GNUstep libraries can also be used from Java and Guile, and some information
on this usage is also included.

The manual does not cover installation instructions as these vary from system
to system, and are documented fairly well in the GNUstep
@uref{../../../User/GNUstep/gnustep-howto_toc.html, HOWTO}.

The target audience for this manual is the C, C++, or Java programmer that
wishes to learn to use Objective-C effectively.  We assume that, while the
reader is able to understand English, it is quite possibly not their native
language.

For detailed class reference documentation the reader is directed to the
GNUstep Base Library @uref{../Reference/index.html, , documentation}, and to
the Apple Cocoa Objective-C Foundation documentation (available through
@url{http://www.apple.com}).
