    <p>

        This document describes how to change the mouse and keyboard 
	mappings so that GNUstep can be used properly.
	This document applies only to the X-Windows based backend. 
          </p>

            <h2><a name="001001000000">Defaults Settings</a></h2>
    <p>

 	  The OpenStep specification requires 3 main different keyboard
	  modifiers: <var>CONTROL</var>, <var>COMMAND</var> and
	  <var>ALTERNATE</var>.
	    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        
	    <var>COMMAND</var> is used to enter key equivalents (keyboard
 	    shortcuts for menus or buttons); for example, usually &apos;Quit&apos;
 	    on the main menu of an application is bound to &apos;q&apos;, so you
 	    may usually quit a GNUstep application by
 	    pressing <em>Command - q</em>.
   	  
      </li>
      <li>
        
	    <var>CONTROL</var> and <var>ALTERNATE</var> are two
	    additional modifiers.  A typical use
	    of <var>ALTERNATE</var> is to scroll by pages rather than
	    by lines; you have to press <var>ALTERNATE</var> while
	    acting on a scrollbar with the mouse.
	  
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>

	  By default, GNUstep uses <code>Control_L</code> (left Ctrl)
	  and <code>Control_R</code> (right Ctrl)
	  as <var>CONTROL</var>, <code>Alt_L</code> (left alt)
	  as <var>COMMAND</var>, and <code>Alt_R</code> (right alt,
	  sometimes called AltGr) as <var>ALTERNATE</var>.  As a
	  special exception, if <code>Alt_R</code> is not bound to any
	  key on your keyboard, GNUstep will try to use
	  <code>Mode_switch</code> for <var>ALTERNATE</var> instead. 
          Some X server map AltGr onto <code>ISO_Level3_Shift</code>. 
          To allow for this the second code <var>ALTERNATE</var> may be
          bound to this key.
	    </p>
    <p>

	  If this layout does not work for you, because your keyboard
	  misses some of these keys, or they have different X names or
	  they conflict heavily with your window manager shortcuts (or
	  for any other reason), read on.
	    </p>

	    <h2><a name="001002000000">Changing the Default Settings</a></h2>
    <p>

	  Under GNUstep, you may change the default as you wish: 
	  you may choose which keys of your keyboard you want 
	  to use for <var>CONTROL</var>, <var>COMMAND</var> and <var>ALTERNATE</var> 
	  (You may even use different keys for different GNUstep applications, 
	  without conflict).  These settings are internal to GNUstep, 
	  and will not influence the behaviour of other X apps.  
	    </p>
    <p>

	  You may choose up to 2 keys per modifier.  
	    </p>
    <p>

	  Note that, if your keyboard is properly set up for X, 
	  you should <em>not</em> need to remap your X keyboard 
	  to use GNUstep.  By changing the defaults, you should be able 
	  to use GNUstep whatever the X keyboard mapping might be.
	    </p>
    <p>

	  What you have to do, is simply to instruct GNUstep to use 
	  different keys for <var>CONTROL</var>, <var>COMMAND</var> and <var>ALTERNATE</var>. 
	    </p>
    <p>

	  The keys to use are determined at the application startup, 
	  by reading the user defaults database.  
	    </p>
    <p>


	  To set the keys which will act as <var>CONTROL</var> you have to set 
	  <code>GSFirstControlKey</code> and <code>GSSecondControlKey</code>; and 
	  similarly for the other keys: 
	    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
         CONTROL
	    <code>GSFirstControlKey</code>
	    <code>GSSecondControlKey</code>
	  
      </li>
      <li>
         COMMAND
	    <code>GSFirstCommandKey</code>
	    <code>GSSecondCommandKey</code>
	  
      </li>
      <li>
         ALTERNATE
	    <code>GSFirstAlternateKey</code>
	    <code>GSSecondAlternateKey</code>
	  
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>

	  Valid values are all the standard strings for X keys.  
	  To disable completely a key, use <code>NoSymbol</code> as preference.
	    </p>
    <p>

	  Each value which you do not explicity set is substituted with 
	  its default value.  The default values are: 
	    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
         GSFirstControlKey
	    <code>Control_L</code>
	  
      </li>
      <li>
         GSSecondControlKey
	    <code>Control_R</code>
	  
      </li>
      <li>
         GSFirstCommandKey
	    <code>Alt_L</code> 
	  
      </li>
      <li>
         GSSecondCommandKey
	    <code>NoSymbol</code>
	  
      </li>
      <li>
         GSFirstAlternateKey
	    <code>Alt_R</code> (or <code>Mode_switch</code> if there is no <code>Alt_R</code>)
	  
      </li>
      <li>
         GSSecondAlternateKey
	    <code>NoSymbol</code>
	  
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>

	  What could go wrong is for example that you don&apos;t have an <code>Alt_L</code>
	  key.  With the default settings, you will not be able to enter the
	  <var>COMMAND</var> key (which is quite an important key).  What you can do in
	  this case is to use <code>Control_R</code> as <var>COMMAND</var>, giving the
	  following commands (from the command line):
	    </p>
<pre>
	  defaults write NSGlobalDomain GSFirstCommandKey Control_R
	  defaults write NSGlobalDomain GSSecondControlKey NoSymbol
	</pre>
    <p>

	  These commands write in the GNUstep user database; 
	  the information will be used every time you start a GNUstep application. 
	    </p>
    <p>

	  The first line sets <code>GSFirstCommandKey</code> to <code>Control_R</code>, which
	  makes <code>Control_R</code> to be read as <var>COMMAND</var>.
	    </p>
    <p>
 
	  The second line disables the second control key, which would otherwise
	  be bound to <code>Control_R</code> by default. If you omit it,
	  <code>Control_R</code> will be used at the same time as <var>COMMAND</var> and as
	  <var>CONTROL</var>, which is not very useful.
	    </p>
    <p>

	  To delete these preferences and restore the defaults, use 
	    </p>
<pre>
	  defaults delete NSGlobalDomain GSFirstCommandKey
	  defaults delete NSGlobalDomain GSSecondControlKey
	</pre>
    <p>

	  To get a list of currently set defaults, you may use 
	    </p>
<pre>
	  defaults read
	</pre>
    <p>

	  The list might be very long; you may want to extract only 
	  setting for the <code>GSFirstCommandKey</code>, for example: 
	    </p>
<pre>
	  defaults read | grep GSFirstCommandKey
	</pre>
    <p>

	  A thing which could go wrong if you are trying to use a
	  setting different from the default, and you do not know
	  much about X, is that you can&apos;t find out the name of one
	  of your key.  In this case, you may try having a look at
	  the output of programs like <code>xmodmap</code> or
	  <code>xkeycaps</code>; even if you do not understand it
	  completely, the output can inspire the right guessing.
	    </p>
    <p>

	  A problem you are likely to encounter is that of conflicts
	  with the window manager keyboard shortcuts.  Good window
	  managers let you change the keyboard shortcuts, so you may
	  move the wm shortcuts that you do not use to keys which do
	  not conflict (at least not too much) with GNUstep.
	    </p>
    <p>

          A final potential worry on X11 has to do with keyboards where hitting
          &apos;shift&apos; or another key can affect the interpretation of a modifier
          key.  For example, on some Apple USB keyboards one key to the left
          of the space bar maps to &quot;Option&quot; without shift pressed, and &quot;Alt&quot;
          when it IS pressed.  Such keyboard mappings are often useful in
          non-English contexts to access accents or non-Roman characters.
          However if such a key is used as a modifier in GNUstep problems can
          occur when trying to use the modifier in conjunction with a shifted
          character.  In particular, you will need to hit and release the
          modifier and the shift key in a particular order, or else things
          will not work as expected, and the modifier may become &quot;stuck&quot;.  If
          you experience such a problem, set the GNUstep back default
          <code>GSModifiersAreKeys</code> to <code>YES</code>.
