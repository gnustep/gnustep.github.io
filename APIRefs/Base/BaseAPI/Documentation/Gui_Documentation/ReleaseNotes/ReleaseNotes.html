            <h2><a name="001005000000">0.26.1</a></h2>
    <p>

	  This version is released to conincide with version 1.25.1 of
	  gnustep-base, which contains changes required for this version of
	  gnustep-gui and gnustep-back.
	    </p>
    <p>

	  It includes an important workaround for users of GNUstep
	  Objective-C Runtime (libobjc2) and non-fragile ABI to avoid a bug
	  in interaction between the clang compiler and the runtime
	  when non-fragile ABI is in use. Specifically, Clang and the
	  runtime may disagree on what is the offset of an ivar
	  in a class&apos;s RAM. This manifested in a crash at application
	  startup due to misalignment of _gcontext inside NSThread. See
	  the
	  <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/discuss-gnustep/2017-12/msg00129.html">mailing list discussion</a>
	  for more information.
	    </p>
    <p>

      	    <h2><a name="001013000000">0.22.0</a></h2>
    <p>

	  This is a major new stable release of GUI. Note that to improve stability, some features that were in previous releases have been removed. Newer and better implementation of these features will be added back soon. These include use of ghostscript and ImageMagic to automatically translate image formats, and an implementation of copy-on-scroll in NSClipView. Also note that this version is binary incompatible with previous versions on 64-bit systems due to changes in some variables based on changes in GNUstep base to the type of NSNotFound.
	  New features include:
	    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Support for drawing the GUI with a scale factor, for high-DPI monitors.</dt>
      <dd>
        
	      
        <p>

		This is enabled automatically on Windows when the system DPI setting is changed from its default of 96 in the Windows control panel. It can be enabled on X11 (or the default overridden on Windows) by setting the GSScaleFactor user default. For example, setting this to 1.5 would make everything appear 50% larger.
	              </p>
        
	      
        <p>

		The scale factor is implemented in GSWindowDecorationView; we use NSView&apos;s built-in scaling support and call -[NSWindow userSpaceScaleFactor] to determine how to manipulate the bounds and frame rect of the window decoration view. NSUnscaledWindowMask is respected, if it is part of a window&apos;s style mask. Note that changing the scale factor without restarting applications is currently unsupported, and all screens currently share the same scale factor. Both of these limitations should be reasonably easy to fix in a future release, however.

Mac OS X 10.6 drawing methods (-[NSImage drawInRect:fromRect:operation:fraction:respectFlipped:hints:]). The rep selection code was completely overhauled, and it should work much better with images containing many reps. In particular, the DPI metadata in images is now respected, and TIFF images containing multiple resolutions are now fully supported.        </p>
        
	    
        <p>
Icons are now better supported. By icon, we mean an NSImage whose representations are not all of the same point size. Icons are usually ICNS or TIFF files. (Note that we aren&apos;t talking about a TIFF containing sub-images with different pixel sizes but the same point sizes.) The important thing about icons is -[NSImage size] should not be called, because the icon doesn&apos;t have one single size in points, but many sizes, so it&apos;s not clear which will be returned from this method. Similarly, -[NSImage drawAtPoint:fromRect:operation:fraction:] should be avoided, as should the -compositeToPoint: family of methods, since these use -[NSImage size] to determine how big to draw the image. The benefit of icons is that when -[NSImage drawInRect:fromRect:operation:fraction:] is called, the rep with the largest point size smaller than or equal to the rect to be drawn in will be chosen, resulting in better looking output. For best results, call drawInRect: with a point size you expect the icons to have, like 16x16 or 64x64.        </p>

      <dt>Interface version change</dt>
      <dd>
        
	    The interface version of the gui library has changed in
	    this release.
	    There is no single reason for this change. Arguably, it
	    should have been done long ago. In the future the
	    interface version will only change with releases that
	    have a new minor version number (that&apos;s the second number in the
	    release number). Applications, libraries and tools that
	    wish to use this new version must be recompiled
	    (otherwise, they&apos;ll use the older version of the library).
	    
      </dd>
      <dt>PPD&apos;s removed</dt>
      <dd>
        
	      All the PPD&apos;s have been removed from the gui library
	      into a separate package (gnustep-ppd). There still
	      exists a single Generic Postscript Printer PPD which
	      should work in many cases for printing using the
	      standard <var>lpr</var> interface. In the future, a
	      <var>CUPS</var> interface should be available that provides
	      all the necessary printer information automatically. If
	      you still want use of the PPD&apos;s, you must install the
	      gnustep-ppd package, although this is not required for
	      use of gnustep-gui.

      <dt>Printing framework</dt>
      <dd>
        
	      The printing framework was generalized to allow for
	      various types of native printing systems. The lpr
	      system is the only complete one, although CUPS printing
	      is in the works. As such, the printing classes were
	      revamped to handle this, and the actual system-specific
	      code is loaded from a bundle.
