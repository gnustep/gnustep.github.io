<span id="Browsers-1"></span><h2 class="chapter">12 Browsers</h2>
<span id="Browsers"></span>
<span id="index-browsers_002c-definition"></span>
<span id="index-controls_002c-browsers"></span>
<p>A <em>browser</em> is a special type of matrix control, useful for the display of hierachial or tree-like data. They use vertical lists of cells, in which some cells can be selected so that they display the &quot;branches&quot; of a tree in the adjacent pane. In this way, a user can easily navigate a hierachy, such as a filesystem which has many directories and sub-directories.
</p>
<p>In fact, the textual data in a browser can be accessed using path like string components, such as <samp>/path/to/leaf</samp> or <samp>/usr/local/lib</samp>. A good example of it&rsquo;s use in filesystems is GWorkspace, GNUstep&rsquo;s file manager application.<a id="DOCF15" href="#FOOT15"><sup>15</sup></a>.
</p>
<span id="index-leaf"></span>
<span id="index-branch"></span>
<span id="index-paridgms_002c-leaves-and-branches"></span>
<p>We introduce the concept of <em>leaves</em> and <em>branches</em>. A <em>leaf</em> is a simple browser cell that only display&rsquo;s text; it does not open a new browser pane with sub-cells when it is selected. A <em>branch</em> both display text, and when selected, it fills the pane to the right with a list of leaves and/or branches that represent a group of cells logically below this one. A branch shows an arrow to indicate that it can be selected to display sub-cells. It is useful when dealing with tree-structures such as that modelled in Computer Sciencei courses.
</p>
<p>Each pane in the browser view is actually a one-column matrix (an <code>NSMatrix</code> object) which can be returned.
</p>
<p>Like many other controls, browsers define their own cell class, known as <code>NSBrowserCell</code>. It provides methods that are used to implement the functionality described above. Browsers use a simple delegate to decide how to display your hierachial data, which can be passive or active (see below).

</ul>
<div class="section" id="Browser-Cells">
<h3 class="section">12.1 Browser Cells</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, <code>NSBrowserCell</code> is used to implement the cells&rsquo;s placed in a browser. As a class it is quite simple, and warrants little attention. 
</p>
<p>It responds to all the methods in <code>NSCell</code>, such as <code>setText:</code> and the set value methods. Additionally, we can find out if it is a leaf using the <code>-isLeaf</code> method, and set whether or not it is a leaf using the <code>-setLeaf:</code> method.
</p>
<p>You can set whether the browser cell is selected using the <code>-set</code> method, and reset it using the <code>-reset</code> method. A cell shows that it is selected (or &quot;set&quot;) when it is highlighted.
</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Browser-Methods">
<h3 class="section">12.2 Browser Methods</h3>

<p>Browsers provide a number of methods used for customising their behaviour, setting their data and getting information about their state.
</p>
<p>The path to the currently selected item (as described above) can be found using the <code>-path</code> method. You can find out the path leading upto a column with the <code>-pathToColumn:</code> method. An easy way of setting the current path is the <code>-setPath:</code> operator.
</p>
<p>You can customize the appearance of a browser and it&rsquo;s columns in various ways. Use <code>-setSeparatesColumns:</code> to have each column drawn in a separate pane. <code>-setTakesTitleFromPreviousColumn:</code> has it take the title displayed in the current column from the cell selected in the previous column, while <code>-setTitle:ofColumn:</code> allows you to set a column title directly. <code>-setTitled:</code> changes whether column titles are displayed at all.
</p>
<p>The types of operations permitted by the user can be changed as well. <code>-setAllowsMultipleSelection:</code> can be used to allow multiple selection, while <code>-setAllowsEmptySelection:</code> can be used to permit nothing to be selected. Use <code>-setAllowsBranchSelection:</code> to allow multiple branches to be selected when in multiple selection mode.
</p>
<p>The first and last column visible in the browser is found via the <code>-firstVisibleColumn</code> and <code>-lastVisibleColumn</code> respectively.
</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Browser-Delegate">
<h3 class="section">12.3 Browser Delegate</h3>

<span id="index-browsers_002c-delegate"></span>
<span id="index-protocols_002c-NSBrowserDelegate"></span>
<span id="index-defintiion_002c-active-and-passive-delegates"></span>
<p>The delegate for a browser is used to gather it&rsquo;s data. It can be optionally <em>passive</em> or <em>active</em>, the difference being that active delegates instantiate the browser cell&rsquo;s themselves, whilst passive delegates leave this to <code>NSBrowser</code>. As a result, you can only implement one or the other subset of methods in <code>NSBrowserDelegate</code> informal protocol..
</p>
<p>A <em>passive</em> delegate must implement the <code>-browser:numberOfRowsInColumn:</code>, returning the number of rows to appear in the specified column number. On the other hand, <em>active</em> delegates must implement <code>-browser:createRowsForColumn:inMatrix:</code> and create the cells for that column proactively. You can only implement one of these methods; not both.
</p>
<p>All browser delegates can implement <code>-browser:willDisplayCell:atRow:column:</code>, a method called by the browser object before a particular cell is displayed so that the delegate can set up its properties. This method is a must for passive delegates. Another method that should be implemented is <code>-browser:selectRow:inColumn:</code>, as it is the delegate&rsquo;s responsibility to select cells (often by calling <code>-set</code> on the corresponding <code>NSBrowserCell</code> object). This method returns whether or not the cell was selected.
</p>
<p>You can optionally implement a number of other delegate methods if you wish. <code>-browser:titleOfColumn:</code> is called to get the title for a certain column, returned as a string, before the column is drawn.
</p>
<p>Keeping track of when the browser scrolls can be accomplished by implementing the <code>-browserWillScroll:</code> and/or the <code>-browserDidScroll:</code> methods. You can also specify to the browser whether or not columns are &quot;valid&quot; by implementing the <code>-browser:isColumnValid:</code> method. This is called by the browser in response to its <code>-validateVisibleColumn:</code> method, which checks whether a column is invalid and needs redrawing.
