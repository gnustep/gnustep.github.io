.TH MAKE_SERVICES 1 "October 2003" GNUstep "GNUstep System Manual"
.SH NAME
make_services \- generate GNUstep services info

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B make_services
.RB [ --test  
.IR filename
.RB ]
.RB [ "--verbose\fP" | "--quiet\fP" ]
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B make_services
builds a validated cache of service information for use by
programs that want to access the GNUstep services facility.
Additionally, it builds a list of applications and service bundles found
in the standard directories. This cache is usually stored in the file named 
.I .GNUstepServices
in the user's GNUstep directory.
.P
Most commonly,
.I make_services
is called from within the GNUstep.sh or GNUstep.csh script to update the
service information every time the GNUstep environmet is set up, i.e. 
in a login script. But of course it is possible to run
.I make_services
from the command line whenever you wish, for example after having installed
a new application or service.
.PP
The 
.I Services
menu in an application's mainmenu is usually updated automatically. However, it
may be necessary to close an open or torn off menu for the changes to appear.
Also, the workspace manager may have to be closed and restarted for file 
association changes to take effect.
.P
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB--test \fIfilename"
check that property list 
.I filename
contains a valid service information.
.IP "\fB--quiet"
suppress warnings (not recommended but useful in login scripts).
.IP "\fB--verbose"
give verbose output.
.IP "\fB--help"
show small help screen.
.PP
.SH EXAMPLES
Simply rebuild the cache of service information:
.PP
.I make_services
.PP
Check whether the file ServiceInfo.plist contains a valid service description:
.PP
.I make_services --test ServiceInfo.plist
.P
.SH NOTES
Giving both
.I --quiet
and
.I --verbose
on the command line will result in verbose output, ignoring the
.I --quiet
argument.
