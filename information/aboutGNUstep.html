          <h1 class="page-header" >Introduction to GNUstep</h1>
          <p>GNUstep is a free, object-oriented, cross-platform
            development environment that strives for simplicity and elegance.
            GNUstep is based on and strives to be completely compatible with the <a
                                                                                    href="http://developer.apple.com">Cocoa</a>
            specification developed by Apple (Previously NeXT Software, Inc.).</p>

          <h2 class="page-header" >GNUstep is...</h2>
          <h3>...an object-oriented tool development kit</h3>
          <p>
            GNUstep-make and GNUstep-base make up
            the core libraries contain a complete system for writing non-graphic
            tools in Objective-C. The make package allows you to setup a simple
            and powerful system for building, installing and packaging your
            tools. The base package includes all the classes necessary for writing
            an incredible array of tools, from wrappers for system tools to tools
            for communicating with web and other types of servers.
          </p>
          <h3>...and a graphical development kit</h3>
          <p>The core libraries contain classes for developing a complete
            graphical application for almost any purpose. Along with our
            object-oriented, graphical development applications, <a
                                                                    href="../experience/ProjectCenter.html">ProjectCenter</a> and
            <a href="../experience/Gorm.html">Gorm</a> it's simple to write very
            complex commercial applications in weeks or months, rather than years
            (or often, never) in the case of other development environments.
          </p>
          <h3>...and a cross platform development environment</h3>
          <p>
            GNUstep can, currently, allow you to build applications on GNU/Linux,
            Windows, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris and any POSIX compliant UNIX
            based operating system.
          </p>

          <h2 class="page-header">GNUstep is not...</h2>
          <h3>...a desktop</h3>
          <p>The GNUstep project supplies several official default <a
                                                                      href="../experience/apps.html">applications</a>, such as a Workspace
            Manager and a Preferences application, but GNUstep project itself is
            not a desktop project.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Several GNUstep applications have been written to provide a powerful
            user experience for working on your
            computer.
            Most of these are they provided by the GNUstep project.<br>
            There are separate projects for providing a complete Desktop experience
            with GNUstep by extending and leveraging on it, each one has different
            philosophies.<br>
            You may want to look at:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.etoile-project.org/">Etoile</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.nongnu.org/gap/">The GNUstep Application
                Project</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.nongnu.org/backbone/">Project Backbone</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>The GNUstep project does not provide a window manager; you can use
            any window manager you want, although we recommend that you use <a
                                                                               href="http://www.windowmaker.info/">WindowMaker</a> for a better
            experience. The various desktop projects may offer their own window
            manager though.</p>
          <h3>...an operating system clone</h3>
          <p>GNUstep is not an operating system clone. It is not a distribution
            of
            GNU/Linux, FreeBSD or any other operating system now, nor will it be in
            the
            future. Although other people may decide to package an operating system
            with GNUstep as a front end.
          </p>
          <h3>...a window manager</h3>
          <p>GNUstep is <a href="wm.html">not a window manager</a>. And the
            libraries are not used by <a href="http://www.windowmaker.info/">WindowMaker</a>
            at present,
            although WindowMaker shares a similar look.</p>
          <p>At no stage will you ever 'run' GNUstep - you will run applications
            and tools and will make use of its services. At some point you may
            well find packages distributed as 'GNUstep' systems in the way that
            you get 'GNU/Linux' systems packaged today. Look at
            the <a href="http://livecd.gnustep.org/">GNUstep Live CD</a>
            for example.
          </p>

          <h3>Additions to Cocoa</h3>
          <p>In addition to the Cocoa API, GNUstep
            also implements many additional classes and methods. GNUstep is written
            in the
            object-oriented language <a
                                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C">Objective-C</a>, a
            superset of C which adds object-orientation to C. Objective-C is very
            simple, yet very powerful. GNUstep also includes bindings to other
            languages such as Java (JIGS) and Ruby (RIGS).</p>
          <p>For more information, see the following <a href="statement.html">testimonial</a>
            from a GNUstep user.</p>
          <h3>Why should I learn Objective-C?</h3>
          <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C">Objective-C</a>
            gives you the full power of a true object-oriented
            language with exactly one syntax addition to C and a dozen
            additional keywords. Its power lies in its elegance and
            simplicity.</p>
          <h3>Why should I use GNUstep?</h3>
          <p>GNUstep provides an excellent, mature framework for writing good
            applications. There's good anecdotal evidence
            that <a href="http://developer.apple.com">Cocoa</a> developers have
            written very complex commercial
            applications in weeks or months, rather than years (or often,
            never) in the case of other development environments. Using the
            visual interface modeling application, you can construct a decent
            user interface skeleton in a day or so with no coding.</p>
          <h3>Why not just use GNOME/KDE, X11, and C/C++?</h3>
          <p>GNUstep works with GNOME, KDE, as well as many X11-based window
            managers. GNUstep runs on top of X11. You can still do programming
            in C (since Objective-C is a pure superset of C), and GCC will
            eventually support the mixing of C++ and Objective-C code in the
            SAME file. GNUstep frees you to develop cross-platform applications
            without the work of developing an OS independent framework from
            scratch. It gives you lots of functionality, including Font Panels,
            Unicode strings, and even Distributed Objects.</p>
          <h3>License</h3>
          <p>The GNUstep libraries are covered under the <a
                                                            href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">GNU Lesser (Library)
              Public License</a>. This generally means you can use these
            libraries in any program (even non-free programs) without affecting
            the license of your program or any other libraries GNUstep is
            linked with. If you distribute the GNUstep libraries along with
            your program, you must make the improvements you have made to the
            GNUstep libraries freely available. The stand-alone tools in
            GNUstep are under the standard <a
                                              href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>.</p>
          <p>GNUstep-Base depends on the the libffi or ffcall
            libraries, which provide stack frame handling for NSInvocation and
            NSConnection. Libffi is the recommended default option for most
            platforms, the ffcall library contains a special
            exception for GNUstep: "Ffcall is under GNU GPL. As a special
            exception, if
used in GNUstep or in derivate works of GNUstep, the included parts
            of ffcall are under GNU LGPL" (Text in quotes provided by the
            author of ffcall).</p>
          <h3>Design</h3>
          <p>The GNUstep logo has been designed by Ayis Theseas Pyrros. It
            stands for the "yin-yang" of objects taking you "a couple of steps"
            further.</p>
