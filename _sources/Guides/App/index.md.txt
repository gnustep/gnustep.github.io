# Building Apps with GORM

This is the traditional way to write GNUstep apps. You should start with [Convertor](2_Convertor/2.1.md), and then you can either go through the rest of them in order, or you can look at the topics below to see what you'll learn from each.

[**ðŸ‘‰ Let's get going!**](2_Convertor/2.1.md)

**Prerequisites:**  
* Basic knowledge of the command-line
* Basic knowledge of programming concepts
* A desktop computer
    * If you're willing to tinker around, you could use a tablet with the Termux or iSH apps, or a jailbroken e-reader, but we don't have any instructions yet.
