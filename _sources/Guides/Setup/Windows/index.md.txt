First, you should set up a development environment following [the SDK setup guide](sdk-setup). Then you can either [build GNUstep](building-windows-msvc) or [install GNUstep from the prebuilt binaries](installing-windows-msvc). Then, [set up and use GNUstep in MSYS2](using-windows-msvc-msys2) and [set up VS Code](ide-setup).
